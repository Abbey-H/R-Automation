# R-Automation
A place where I put all of my data automation scripts (big or small) I believe would be useful to share! 

Script #1) "SplittingDataFiles.R"
This code was written to loop through large data files (.CSV in this case, but that can be changed) from a particular directory, split up each datafile according to the phase in the psychology task (specified by a particular column called "Phase" in the dataset), and save the data from each phase in a new folder with a new name.
